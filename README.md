# **Image Recognition using Various Known Predefined Models**
For this purpose of study I have selected to model which are widely popular and known as well.
- TensorFlow Kera
- Pytorch (using YOLO)
Both of Them are good and well implemented model which can be used for faster processing and development.

But **TensorFlow Kera** has found out to be better model than the YOLO.

Below are Implenetation code for both of the algorithms.

## Result
